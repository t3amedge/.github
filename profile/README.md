# Hiya, runners.
We're Team Edge, a one-man team working on bots that empower your Discord experience by putting you as the first priority with everything that we offer being completely free of charge.

# What are your current projects?
We are currently working on Evelyn, our most advanced project yet based on our old bot Jinx, which you can find archived under the Jinx repository alongside the Evelyn Music Module which is a standalone version of her current music system. With that, we are also working on something new, perhaps something more cyberpunk-ish?

# Where can I support you guys?
While we don't paywall features of our projects, we do offer a subscription which gives you an early look at upcoming features of Evelyn that is completely optional and is only for those that want a way to support us. You can access our Ko-Fi and other links using the links under our banner.
